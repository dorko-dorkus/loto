# Security

Security considerations for the pilot process.

- Review generated artifacts for sensitive information before export and attachment.
- Data flows only through approved environments (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
- Apply least-privilege permissions when accessing pilot resources.
- Report incidents immediately in `#pilot-support`.
