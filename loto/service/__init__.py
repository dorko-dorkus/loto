"""Service layer wrappers for orchestrating LOTO operations.

This package exposes lightweight, side-effect free helpers that compose
core library components into higher level workflows suitable for use in
API handlers or other service layers.  The wrappers defined here avoid
performing any I/O so they can be used in pure functions and easily unit
tested.
