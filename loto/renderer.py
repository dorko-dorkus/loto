"""Document renderer for the LOTO planner.

This module contains the :class:`Renderer` class which is responsible
for producing human‐readable outputs, such as PDF isolation sheets and
JSON summaries suitable for machine consumption. Rendering operations
should be deterministic and avoid side effects beyond file generation.

Only class and method stubs are provided here. An actual implementation
would use a PDF generation library (e.g., ReportLab or python-pptx) and
serialize plan data to JSON.

        sim_report: SimReport
