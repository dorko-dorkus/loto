"""Graph builder for the LOTO planner.

This module defines the :class:`GraphBuilder` class which is responsible
for constructing domain-specific connectivity graphs from raw input
files (e.g., CSV exports of line lists, valve registers, and drains).
Graphs are used by the isolation planner to compute minimal cut sets and
simulate isolation states.

Each graph is a directed multigraph where nodes represent equipment
tags, ports, actuators, and other components, and edges represent
connections (pipes, tubes, lines). Graph validation logic ensures
consistency of the input data (e.g., no dangling references or
impossible mediums). Only method signatures are provided.
