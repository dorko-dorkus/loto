"""Rule engine for the LOTO planner.

The rule engine is responsible for loading configuration files (e.g.
YAML/JSON rule packs) that define isolation standards for each energy
domain (steam, condensate, instrument air, electrical, etc.). It also
performs static validation on the rule data and exposes it to other
components via a simple API. Only method signatures are provided here.

Example usage::

    from loto.rule_engine import RuleEngine

    engine = RuleEngine()
    rule_pack = engine.load("/config/rules.yml")
    current_hash = engine.hash(rule_pack)

Note that in this stub implementation, method bodies are intentionally
left blank (using ``pass``) because the user requested only class and
method stubs. Detailed logic will be implemented in future iterations.

    This class encapsulates the logic for reading rule files from disk

    detect changes to the rule pack and to include version information
