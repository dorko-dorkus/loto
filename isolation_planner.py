"""Isolation planner for the LOTO system.

The :class:`IsolationPlanner` computes minimal cut sets for isolating
energy sources from target assets based on domain graphs produced by
the :class:`loto.graph_builder.GraphBuilder` and rules loaded by
the :class:`loto.rule_engine.RuleEngine`. The planner also applies
domain-specific constraints such as double-block-and-bleed requirements
and bypass handling.

Method bodies in this stub are intentionally left unimplemented. Use
these signatures as a starting point for a full implementation.

        A mapping from energy domain to the list of isolation actions
